# Fruit Search Bar Project

This project implements an Autofill Search Bar that suggests various types of fruits based on user input, similar to how search suggestions work on search engines like Google. When you start typing in the search bar, a dropdown appears with suggestions for possible matches. Clicking on one of these suggestions populates the search bar with that selection.

## Features

- **Dynamic Suggestions**: As you type, the search bar suggests fruits that match the entered text.
- **Clickable Suggestions**: Clicking on a suggestion autofills the search bar with that fruit name.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile browsers.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to be easily integrated into larger projects.
